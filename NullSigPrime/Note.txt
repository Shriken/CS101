Due to the masses of repetitive code required in dealing with setting
up and updating the neural network and the time and hassle involved
with typing them out "by hand," we opted to generate much of the code
using Python scripts. Unfortunately those scripts couldn't be
retrieved from the school file server in time, so they will not be
included in build 1.0.0 of the project. Hopefully they will be added
in future.

Update:
Python code added. It generates a text file divided by spaces, each 
section of which can be copied into the file.
